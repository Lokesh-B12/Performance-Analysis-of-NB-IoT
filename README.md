# Performance-Analysis-of-NB-IoT

Simulations were performed using a discrete event based simulator program written by us in C++ language. The simulator  was executed on a Linux platform.  For the purpose of simulation, the random access algorithm of NB-IoT has been modelled as multi-band multi-channel slotted ALOHA. An ideal physical layer has been assumed to isolate the effect of the physical layer on the random access performance. Time is divided into equal sized slots with slot length being the NPRACH periodicity. Packets are generated according to the Poisson process with appropriate rate as per the simulation configuration. Simulation is run for a large number of slots so that the statistical averages obtained are within 5% error. Various system parameters defined in Table I are set according to the values given by Table II for different runs of simulation.  According to 3GPP, the number of repetitions in uplink can go up to 128 in powers of 2 i.e., 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,[19]. In our simulations we considered repetitions of 2,4 and 16 for preamble and data in CE level 0,1 and 2 respectively. Number of UEs (N) are varied from 900, 3000 to 48000 in steps of 3000.
